As a result, the controller does not benefit significantly from longer lookahead or terminal extrapolation, unlike in stabilization tasks where future behavior must be inferred more structurally through horizon length and terminal shaping.\n",

    "So far, we have considered MPC formulations under the assumption that the system dynamics are perfectly known and that there are no disturbances affecting the system. However, in many real-world applications, such assumptions rarely hold: model uncertainties, external disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics often degrade controller performance or even cause constraint violations. To address these challenges, we now turn to Robust Model Predictive Control (Robust MPC) — a class of methods designed to ensure constraint satisfaction and stability even in the presence of bounded disturbances or model-mismatches.\n",

    "Robust MPC encompasses a variety of formulations, each differing in how they handle uncertainty and guarantee robustness. These include min-max MPC, scenario-based MPC, and tube-based MPC, among others. In this section, we focus on the tube-based approach, which is conceptually simple yet powerful enough to handle bounded additive disturbances. It works by planning a nominal trajectory and ensuring that the true system state remains within a bounded tube around it, using a combination of feedback and constraint tightening."

    "\n",
    "One of the key features that distinguishes Robust MPC (RMPC) from standard MPC is its explicit consideration of worst-case disturbances in the control design. To ensure robust constraint satisfaction under all allowable disturbances, RMPC requires the computation of a **Robust Invariant Set (RIS)** — a set of states from which the system can be kept within constraints, regardless of disturbance realizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we present how the RIS can be recursively constructed from the original disturbance set using set operations. This forms a fundamental step unique to RMPC, as it quantifies the margin of robustness and is later used to tighten constraints and guarantee recursive feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we visualize the performance of RMPC in the phase portrait, comparing the actual trajectory with the predicted nominal states and illustrating how the system safely remains within the robust tube defined by the RIS."

    "The figure above compares the performance of a standard linear MPC controller and a RMPC controller under a disturbed scenario. Although both controllers successfully guide the system toward the target, key differences emerge in how each handles uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the position and velocity plots, we observe that the RMPC trajectory (blue) is generally more conservative but smoother compared to the baseline MPC (red dashed). This is a direct consequence of RMPC’s tube-based formulation, which anticipates worst-case disturbances and proactively tightens constraints using the robust invariant set (RIS).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the input plot, RMPC tends to inject slightly more conservative control early on to preempt deviation, whereas linear MPC only reacts to observed state errors. Despite similar nominal trajectories, the RMPC ensures that the real trajectory stays within a guaranteed safety tube — something the baseline controller cannot ensure without explicit disturbance modeling.\n",
