    "\n",
    "Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), as introduced by Schulman et al. in their original paper *“Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms”* (2017), is one of the most popular policy gradient methods in Reinforcement Learning. It was proposed by OpenAI as a **simplified and more stable alternative** to Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). PPO belongs to the family of **on-policy actor-critic methods**, and it’s widely used in both research and practical applications (e.g., training agents to play Dota 2, as shown in the core course slide). The core idea is to **avoid large destructive updates** to the policy by **constraining or clipping** how much the policy is allowed to change at each step, thereby preventing performance degradation or training instability caused by overly aggressive policy updates — this is precisely where the term \"Proximal\" comes from.\n",

    "#### **Core Components of PPO**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Actor-Critic Structure**: \n",
    "\n",
    "   PPO adopts an actor-critic architecture, which is a foundational design pattern in modern policy gradient reinforcement learning methods. This structure separates the roles of **decision making (actor)** and **value estimation (critic)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Actor**: The Policy Network\n",
    "\n",
    "     * The **actor** is responsible for selecting actions based on the current state.\n",
    "     * It parameterizes the **policy** $\\pi_\\theta(a|s)$, which is a probability distribution over actions given the state $s$.\n",
    "     * During training, the actor is updated to maximize expected return by following the **policy gradient**, typically using advantage-weighted updates:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\nabla_\\theta \\log \\pi_\\theta(a|s) \\cdot \\hat{A}(s, a) \\right]\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * **Critic**: The Value Network\n",
    "\n",
    "     * The **critic** provides a **baseline estimate** of how good a state is, helping to reduce the variance of the policy gradient.\n",
    "     * It learns the **state value function** $V^\\pi(s)$, which estimates the expected return from state $s$ under the current policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "     * The critic is typically trained by minimizing the squared error between the predicted value and empirical return (or bootstrapped target):\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{critic}} = \\left( V_\\phi(s_t) - R_t \\right)^2\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Advantage Estimation with State-Dependent Baseline (GAE)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * PPO reduces variance in the policy gradient by using a **state-dependent baseline**, typically the value function $V(s)$, instead of relying solely on raw returns $R_t$.\n",
    "  * This leads to the **advantage function**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\hat{A}_t = R_t - V(s_t)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    which measures how much better or worse an action performed compared to the expected value of the state.\n",
    "  * To further improve this estimate, PPO employs **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**, which blends multi-step bootstrapping and Monte Carlo returns to strike a balance between bias and variance. GAE defines the advantage recursively via the **TD residual** $\\delta_t$:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\delta_t = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    and constructs the advantage as an exponentially weighted sum:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    \\hat{A}_t^{GAE(\\lambda)} = \\sum_{l=0}^{\\infty} (\\gamma \\lambda)^l \\delta_{t+l}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "  * Here, $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$ controls the trade-off: lower values reduce variance but introduce more bias, while higher values favor accuracy but increase variance. This technique leads to smoother, more stable advantage estimates and more efficient learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clipped Surrogate Objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * PPO avoids the complexity of trust region methods (like TRPO) by using a **clipping mechanism** to constrain how much the new policy $\\pi_\\theta$ is allowed to deviate from the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}$ during each update.\n",
    "  * The key quantity is the **probability ratio**:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(a_t | s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}}(a_t | s_t)}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    which measures how much more (or less) likely the new policy is to take action $a_t$ at state $s_t$ compared to the old policy.\n",
    "  * The **clipped surrogate objective** then takes the minimum between the unclipped and clipped policy objective:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    L^{CLIP}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\min \\left( r_t(\\theta) \\hat{A}_t,\\ \\text{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1 - \\epsilon, 1 + \\epsilon) \\hat{A}_t \\right) \\right]\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    where $\\hat{A}_t$ is the estimated advantage and $\\epsilon$ is a small positive hyperparameter (typically $\\epsilon = 0.1 \\sim 0.3$).\n",
    "  * This **clip operation prevents the policy from changing too much in a single update step**, which protects against large, destabilizing policy updates that could hurt performance.\n",
    "    * If $r_t(\\theta) > 1 + \\epsilon$: the update would excessively increase the probability of a \"good\" action → clip it down.\n",
    "    * If $r_t(\\theta) < 1 - \\epsilon$: the update would excessively decrease the probability of a \"bad\" action → clip it up.\n",
    "  * Unlike TRPO, which enforces a hard KL-divergence constraint using second-order optimization, PPO uses this **first-order, simple-to-implement clip mechanism** to achieve similar \"proximal\" updates while remaining computationally efficient.\n",

In fact, the paper *“Implementation Matters in Deep RL: A Case Study on PPO and TRPO”* (Engstrom et al., 2020) identifies **9 critical tricks** that have a **significant impact on PPO's performance**. These implementation techniques — such as advantage normalization, observation normalization, proper reward scaling, and value clipping — can be considered when building PPO from scratch or tuning an existing implementation, in order to (at least partially) achieve more stable training and better empirical performance.\n",
