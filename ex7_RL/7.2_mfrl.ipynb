    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, an agent often follows a stochastic policy rather than a fully greedy one, i.e. a probability-mass function $\\pi(u|x)$ that assigns a weight to every action in the current state. An $\\varepsilon$-soft policy is one of the simplest case: with probability $1-\\varepsilon$ the agent takes the greedy action and with $\\varepsilon$ it explores the rest according to that distribution. Sampling from such a policy is crucial, without it the agent can’t keep a balance between exploration and exploitation, expecially in a on-policy RL method.\n",

    "#### **Summary of Each Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model-based Control:**\n",
    "  Provides high performance with accurate models and works well in continuous domains. However, real-time optimization can be computationally intensive, especially in constrained or nonlinear problems. No learning is involved—relies entirely on predictive models and open-loop optimization at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model-based RL:**\n",
    "  Bridges control and learning by computing value functions from a known model (MDP). It guarantees convergence to the optimal policy in discrete settings but is limited by discretization and computational burden in large-scale problems. It serves as a theoretical benchmark but is impractical in continuous domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Model-free RL:**\n",
    "  Trades off model accuracy for direct interaction-based learning. It is more robust to model mismatch and easier to implement when dynamics are unknown. However, it typically requires large amounts of data and careful exploration strategy design to achieve comparable performance. Similar to model-based RL, its classical tabular formulation is limited to discrete domains.\n",
