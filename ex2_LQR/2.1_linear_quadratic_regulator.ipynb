    "### **Chapter 2: Linear Quadratic Regulator**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will provide the implementation of the LQR controller and demonstrate how it can be applied to a specific task (stabilization task). We begin by formulating the finite-horizon discrete-time LQR, where the optimal control policy is computed via backward dynamic programming over a fixed time window. This formulation provides time-varying feedback gains and serves as a natural starting point for understanding the structure of optimal control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then move to the infinite-horizon LQR formulation, which yields a time-invariant feedback gain by solving the algebraic Riccati equation (DARE). This approach is more computationally efficient and widely used in practice when the control objective is to stabilize the system over an indefinite time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we conclude by discussing several limitations of the LQR framework, including its reliance on linearized dynamics, quadratic cost assumptions, and not compatible with constraints. These limitations motivate the exploration of more advanced control methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and reinforcement learning-based approaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Example 1**: When the car moves downhill to the left, the required driving force can be fully provided by the LQR policy, thus allowing leftward movement. Moreover, the target itself is a stable equilibrium point of the nonlinear system, meaning that even in the presence of nonlinear disturbances, the system may exhibit some overshoot but will ultimately stabilize at the target point.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 2**: Unlike in Example 1, when the car moves uphill along the slope, it becomes stuck halfway due to the insufficient input provided by the LQR policy. This is because the linearization point is chosen on the flat platform, leading the LQR controller to compute a policy that only generates inputs sufficient for horizontal motion. However, in order for the car to move uphill, additional input is required to overcome the gravitational force. As a result, the car is unable to generate enough input and ultimately gets stuck halfway up the slope.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 3**: Building upon Example 2, we move the linearization point onto the slope, allowing the LQR controller to recognize the need to generate additional input to counteract the gravitational component when computing the policy. As a result, the car is able to climb up the slope. However, a drawback is that the car cannot be precisely stabilized at the target point, and a noticeable steady-state error appears. This can be interpreted as a loss of control accuracy caused by model mismatch.  \n",

    "In summary, although the LQR policy can be applied to nonlinear systems, its performance cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, when making such attempts, it is crucial to **carefully select the linearization point** to improve performance as much as possible and to mitigate the losses caused by model mismatch.\n",

    "#### **2. Effect of Input Constraints on LQR Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "LQR is formulated under the assumption of **unconstrained inputs**, meaning it does not inherently support input saturation or upper/lower constraints. However, in real-world systems, control inputs such as force, torque, or voltage often have physical limits. When the LQR controller generates control inputs exceeding these limits, the inputs will be **clipped** to the boundaries. This behavior can cause saturation between the actual system trajectory and the ideal trajectory predicted by the LQR controller.\n",
